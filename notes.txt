F.I.R.S.T principles.

Principles, not rules, that we may follow when writing tests:
 - Fast: unit test should be fast. Faster test - faster feedback
 - Independent
 - Repeatable
 - Self-validation
 - Thorough

 Spies vs mocks
  - Spies are not directly injected into SUT
  - Original funtionality is preserved with Spies
  - Spies usually track method calls
